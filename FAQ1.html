    <h2>ARE TATTOOS SAFE?</h2>
    <p>Yes, as long as you go to a reputable tattoo artist that is following all recommended safety precautions. Make sure youâ€™re completely honest with your tattoo artist regarding any medical condition you may have or if prone to fainting. We always recommend getting a good night sleep, having a full meal and some sugar before getting a tattoo to alleviate dizziness, nausea, and to increase your pain tolerance. Getting a tattoo with a low blood sugar level is not ideal.</p>
